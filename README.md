# Hello 👋

I build automation systems and AI-assisted workflows focused on efficiency, scale, and clarity.

## Focus Areas
- Python automation & orchestration
- AI-assisted tooling (LLMs, agentic workflows, RAG)
- Browser automation for repetitive tasks
- Clean, documented, production-minded code

## Selected Projects
- Daily Brief Agent — personalized AI-generated intelligence reports
- Job Search Automation Toolkit — workflow orchestration for applications & outreach
- Portfolio Site — technical case studies & live demos

Currently building systems that reduce human effort through thoughtful automation.
